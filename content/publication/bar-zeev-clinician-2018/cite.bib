 abstract = {Â© 2017 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists The use of nicotine replacement therapy in pregnancy has been debated but evidence suggests that it is safer than smoking. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with: (i) general practitioners and obstetricians from a college database; and (ii) general practitioners with a special interest in Indigenous health. General practitioners had higher odds of prescribing compared to obstetricians. Reading guidelines, confidence, viewing nicotine replacement therapy as safe, effective and with good adherence, also significantly increased the odds of prescription. Clear guidance regarding safety and efficacy, with practical clinical protocols, are required in order to reduce variation in prescribing rates across these clinicians.},
