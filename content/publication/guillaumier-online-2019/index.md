abstract: "Â© 2019 The Author(s). Background: Recurrent stroke is a major contributor to stroke-related disability and costs. Improving health-risk behaviours and mental health has the potential to significantly improve recovery, enhance health-related quality of life (HRQoL), independent living, and lower the risk of recurrent stroke. The primary aim will be to test the effectiveness of an online intervention to improve HRQoL among stroke survivors at 6 months' follow-up. Programme effectiveness on four health behaviours, anxiety and depression, cost-effectiveness, and impact on other hospital admissions will also be assessed. Methods/design: An open-label randomised controlled trial is planned. A total of 530 adults will be recruited across one national and one regional stroke registry and block randomised to the intervention or minimal care control group. The intervention group will receive access to the online programme Prevent 2nd Stroke (P2S); the minimal care control group will receive an email with Internet addresses of generic health sites designed for the general population. The primary outcome, HRQoL, will be measured using the EuroQol-5D. A full analysis plan will compare between groups from baseline to follow-up. Discussion: A low-cost per user option to supplement current care, such as P2S, has the potential to increase HRQoL for stroke survivors, and reduce the risk of second stroke."
